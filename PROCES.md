I made my first plan for the three visualisations. there is a barchart on top that shows the number of years a band is or was active and a timeline that is linked to the barchart.
The timeline shows the bandmembers at and when you where or are bandmembers. The barchart is also linked to a piechart. The piechart the percentage of the original bandmembers that are still active in the band.

# day 2

I started making some datasets for the timeline. No changes.

I changed the barchart to a bubble chart because i wanted to make a new visualisation. The bubble chart shows the number of albums sold.

# day 4

No changes.

The bubble visualisatioin needs axis with new data so i change the visualisation back to a barchart. I dont need to find more data. I can add new visualisations if i have enough time. The band search funtion will work for the timeline and piechart in stead of the bubble chart. 

# day 6

Today i made the barchart and started with the timeline. The timeline does have the timebars now but they are stacked. Only the bar on top is visable.

# day 7

I added a hover function with labels to the timeline. I also made code that searches for the lowest and highest year and determines the part of the timeline that should be visable and started with the piechart. 

# day 8

no changes

# day 9

I added the visualisations together and made the link between the barchart and the other visualisations. I started with the function that detects the overlay between lines on the timeline. 

# day 10

i changed my idea for the pie chart. The pie chart will show how for the best sold albums (20 million or more) how much percent that albums is of their total sales. If no albums where more than 20 million times sold the pie chart will have the same color. I found the data and made the function for the pie chart. 

# day 11

I made my first extra feature. The extra feature sorts the barchart. 

# day 12

I changed the pie chart text to percentages and deleted the old visualisations when you click on a new bar of the barchart. I also made the pie chart tooltip labels and added the number of studio albums that where not 20 million times sold. I think i have to change the number to a sums of the studio albums, live albums and compilation albums because the label says: 25 albums with less than 20 million sales,507 million (20*25=500 million).

# day 13

Today i added the search funtion. I also added the text that show which band you clicked on or searched for.
