# day 1

I made my first plan for the three visualisations. there is a barchart on top that shows the number of years a band is or was active and a timeline that is linked to the barchart.
The timeline shows the bandmembers at and when you where or are bandmembers. The barchart is also linked to a piechart. The piechart the percentage of the original bandmembers that are still active in the band.

# day 2

I started making some datasets for the timeline. No changes to the visualisation.

# day 3

I changed the barchart to a bubble chart because i wanted to make a new visualisation. The bubble chart shows the number of albums sold.

# day 4

No changes.

# day 5

The bubble visualisatioin needs axis with new data so i change the visualisation back to a barchart. I dont need to find more data. I can add new visualisations if i have enough time. The band search funtion will work for the timeline and piechart in stead of the bubble chart. 

# day 6

Today i made the barchart and started with the timeline. The timeline does have the timebars now but they are stacked. Only the bar on top is visable.

# day 7

The timeline visualisation works but only for the Beatles. I added a hover function with labels to the timeline. I also made code that searches for the lowest and highest year and determines the part of the timeline that should be visable and started with the piechart. 

# day 8

no changes

# day 9

I added the visualisations together and made the link between the barchart and the other visualisations. I started with the function that detects the overlay between lines on the timeline. 

# day 10

i changed my idea for the pie chart. The pie chart will show how for the best sold albums (20 million or more) how much percent that albums is of their total sales. If no albums where more than 20 million times sold the pie chart will have the same color. I found the data and made the function for the pie chart. 

# day 11

I made my first extra feature. The extra feature sorts the barchart. 

# day 12

I changed the pie chart text to percentages and deleted the old visualisations when you click on a new bar of the barchart. I also made the pie chart tooltip labels and added the number of studio albums that where not 20 million times sold. I think i have to change the number to a sums of the studio albums, live albums and compilation albums because the label says: 25 albums with less than 20 million sales,507 million (20*25=500 million).

# day 13

Today i added the search funtion. I also added the text that show which band you clicked on or searched for.

# day 14

I added the data to the visualisation. Because some artists are working alone and others (santana) have had 67 artists i had to add a scroll function. The scrollbar has to be down in when you load the visualisation because else you don't see the visualisation (except for santana and earth wind and fire) I also added some instrument collors and tried to add a legend. I also added some text and repositioned the visualisations. 

# day 15

I added the legend to the visualisation. It shows up when the timeline function starts. I also added a code that scrolls down when you search or click on a bar so you can see something happens. I changed the red color from the barchart to gray because the difference between red and green is hard to see for colorblind people. The titles for the pie and barchart where also added.

# day 16

I cleanded up my code. The parts that where not needed i deleted. I also learned to push code onto github. This makes it possible to use better code hub. i scored on 5 of the 10 points so i have to change some code. I also change the albums to compilation albums, live albums and studio albums instead of only studio albums. In the data with best sold albums are also compilation albums so just studio albums wasn't enough. 

# day 17

I tried to change code for a better score in better code hub. My code is better now but still scores 5 out of 10. I tried to change the number of variables and the number of branchpoints. But i don't think i can reduce them more. I changed my README.md and fixed the problems i had with github.

# day 18

I made the REPORT.md and STANDUPS.md. I added the javascript to different files and pushed them on github. I added some more text to the visualisation.

# day 19

The report is finished and i centered the html text for the visualisation.
