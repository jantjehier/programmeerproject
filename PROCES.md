# day 1

I made my first plan for the three visualisations. there is a barchart on top that shows the number of years a band is or was active and a timeline that is linked to the barchart.
The timeline shows the bandmembers at and when you where or are bandmembers. The barchart is also linked to a piechart. The piechart the percentage of the original bandmembers that are still active in the band.

# day 2

I started making some datasets for the timeline. No changes.

# day 3

I changed the barchart to a bubble chart because i wanted to make a new visualisation. The bubble chart shows the number of albums sold.

# day 4

No changes.

The bubble visualisatioin needs axis with new data so i change the visualisation back to a barchart. I dont need to find more data. I can add new visualisations if i have enough time. The band search funtion will work for the timeline and piechart in stead of the bubble chart. 

# day 6

Today i made the barchart and started with the timeline. The timeline does have the timebars now but they are stacked. Only the bar on top is visable.

# day 7

I added a hover function with labels to the timeline. I also made code that searches for the lowest and highest year and determines the part of the timeline that should be visable.
