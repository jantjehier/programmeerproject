### visualisations
### bubble chart: 
I have chosen to make change the barchart i wanted to make to a bubble chart. 
In this bubble chart the size of the bubbles show how much albums are sold. A scale from 75 million to 600 million.
The red and green colors show if a band is still active. If the color is green the band is still active. 
If the color is red the band isn't active anymore. In the dropdown you can sellect if you only want to see the active or inactive bands or both.
The search function makes it possible to search for bands or artists in the bubble chart. 
The bubble you search for gets a border. When you hover over the bubbles the values will show.
### timeline:
There will also be a timeline that is linked to the bubblechart. when you click on a bubble the band shows in the timeline.
In the timeline you can see when a band was active and which musicians played in the band at which moment. Optional there will be lines
that show when the albums where made. This makes it easy to see which musician made which album. It is also optional to make the search function also work for the timeline.
When you hover over a line you can see which instrument was played. On the right there is also a legend that shows the instruments.
### piechart:
The piechart is to show if the bands have changed since the start of the band. The percentage in green are the members that are left of the original band.
The percentage of the beginning band that did leave the band will be shown in red. The piechart will also be linked to the bubble chart.

### linking
the piechart and the timeline will be linked to the bubblechart. 

### extra features
the extra features are the dropdown menu for the bubble chart and the search function for the timeline and bubblechart.
