### Explaination of the image
The barchart visualisation will show the number of years a band or artist is active. The number will show on hover. The color of the bars (red/green) shows if a band is still performing or not. When you click a bar a timeline will appear that shows the bandmembers thrue the years. There are also lines that show when their albums where made. On the right is the timeline legend and a percentage that shows how much per cent of the members are the original members that started the band.

### The Minimum viable product
At least I want to make the time line linked to the barchart and the percentage.
The optional part is the lines for the albums and the dropdown for active or inactive.

### What is the message? 
The visualisation will show how it is possible that some bands are performing for a long time. Do they change members? Do they take breaks? Or are the performers healty enough to perform when they are 80?

### The data
For this visualisation I need datasets with the years where in a band is active. I also need data or timelines that show wich member was a bandmember at a certain time. Optional I need to know in wich year the albums where made. Most of this information I can get from wikipedia.

### technical problems
The technical problems that could arise during the development are the linking of the visualisation, the new timeline visualisation and the way I organize the data. The linking of the visualisation didn't go well in the dataprocessing psets. Some times one of the visualisations didn't work. I also never made a timeline visualisation and there aren't as much timeline visualisations made as line graphs or barcharts. It will be harder to find the right information I need. In the dataprocessing assignments I had to change the data format a lot because it didn't work with the simple JSON files. The best thing I can do to solve this problem is to do a lot of research.
