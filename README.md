### Explaination of the image
The bubble chart visualisation will show the number of albums a band or artist has sold. The bands or artists will be added if the band sold at least 75 milion albums. On the basis of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists. The number will show on hover. The color of the bars (red/green) shows if a band is still performing or not. When you click a bubble a timeline will appear that shows the bandmembers thrue the years. There are also lines that show when their albums where made. On the right is the timeline legend and a pie chart that shows how much per cent of the members are the original members that started the band. There is also a search function where in you can search for a band you want to find in the bubble chart.

### The Minimum viable product
At least I want to make the time line linked to the bubble and the pie chart. I also need the search function and drop down as extra features.
The optional part is the lines for the albums. I can make tables of the albums that where made, and make eventual the album versions. 

### Story
The visualisation will show how it is possible that some bands are performing for a long time. Do they change members? Do they take breaks? Or are the performers healty enough to perform when they are 80? It also shows wich bands sold the most albums.

### The data
For this visualisation I need datasets with the years where in a band is active. I also need data or timelines that show wich member was a bandmember at a certain time. Optional I need to know in wich year the albums where made. 
Most of this information I can get from wikipedia. On wikipedia a couple of bands do have timelines. For the other bands i have to find the data on their wikipedia pages. For the bubble chart i can use the list of best selling music artists. The pie chart data i can calculate.

### technical problems
The technical problems that could arise during the development are the linking of the visualisation, the new timeline and bubble visualisations and the way I organize the data. The linking of the visualisation didn't go well in the dataprocessing psets. Some times one of the visualisations didn't work. I also never made a timeline visualisation and there aren't as much timeline visualisations made as line graphs or barcharts. It will be harder to find the right information I need. In the dataprocessing assignments I had to change the data format a lot because it didn't work with the simple JSON files. All the data i get from the wikipedia pages are slightly different so i have to make changes to them and make the format the same. The best thing I can do to solve this problem is to do a lot of research and work structured.
